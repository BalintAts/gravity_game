### Gravity Game

This project is work in progress.

This is a 2d online videogame, which is being developed in REACT, using HTML5 CANVAS, and plain JAVASCRIPT. 
I will use SpringBoot for the backend.

The goal is to move the spaceship to collect the yellow orbs by gravitating to the planets by pressing space. This can result in interesting trajectories, and new kind of gameplay.
